Abstract.
As the population of the Internet grows rapidly the development of web technologies becomes extremely important. For the evolvement of Web 2.0, web services are essential. Web services are programs that allow computers of different platforms on the web to interactively communicate without the need of extra data for human reading interfaces and formats such as web page structures. Since web service is a future trend for the growth of internet, the tools that are used for development is also important. Although there are many choices of web service frameworks to choose from, developers should choose the framework that fits best to their application based on performance, time and effort for the framework. In this project, we chose four common frameworks to compare them in both qualitative and quantitative metrics. After running the tests, the results are statistically analyzed by SAS..

1. Introduction.
For going on trips to other states or countries, the person usually requires to buy airplane tickets, rent a car, and make reservations for hotels to stay at. When dealing with airplane tickets, most of the time the person even has to buy several tickets for some stops instead of a ticket that takes the person directly to the final destination.  Looking up the airplane arrival and departure times to connect each flight might take hours of searching and planning. What if there was a virtual agent that could do this all in just a few seconds? So usually people would look for agents to do this for them. But what if this agent was actually is actually a virtual agent online. If the person just enters the location he wants to start from, the destination, the desired time for departure or arrival, and all the information required into the computer, in a snap, the computer shows all the results for the person to choose from and purchase the tickets. Even better, such virtual agents could have possibilities to also show information of the car rentals and hotels at the destination and reserve them for you. By using this type of virtual agent, could save much effort and time and can also be more accurate than human agents. Such technology relies on the development and widespread of web services.
Instead of developing a web service application from scratch, there are many open source frameworks that make development much easier. Which of these frameworks would be a better choice for web service application development? This study compares four popular open source frameworks both qualitatively and quantitatively by doing several tests and analysis. The four frameworks are Apache Axis, JBossWS, XFire, and Hessian. More introductions of web services are done in Section 2.  Section 3 describes the four frameworks that are used in this study. In Section 4, the metrics that are used to measure the frameworks are explained in more detail.  Section 5 introduces the statistical analysis methods that are use to analyze the measured results. In Section 6, the test results are shown and analyzed. The conclusions are in Section 7.

2. Web Service Frameworks.
Since web services are designed to transfer data in common ways, several companies and groups developed web service frameworks for the convenience of web service developers so that they do not need to write a complete web service from scratch. Some of the popular frameworks are Apache Axis, JBossWS, Codehaus XFire, and Caucho Hessian. In this section, these frameworks are going to be introduced.

==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
2.1. Apache Axis.
Apache Axis (Apache Extensible Interaction System) is an open source, Java and XML based Web service framework created by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). The foundation is a non-profit corporation that mainly produces software for network use, such as servers and frameworks for servers. Their projects are well known to be collaborative, consensus based development process and free or open source software. The Apache Axis package has an implementation of a SOAP server and API’s for generating and deploying web service applications. The SOAP engine constructs SOAP processors like clients, servers, and gateways. This allows the servers and clients to communicate through SOAP messages. The API supports a variety of languages.  Besides the Java version, a C++ implementation is also available. It allows developers to construct their application in a variety of ways. The easiest method only requires changing the file name extension from “.java” to “.jws”. The downside of such a method is lacks flexibility for further configuration.

2.2. JBossWS.
JBossWS is JBoss' implementation of J2EE compatible web services. The framework is designed to fit better in the overall JBoss architecture and is generally more suitable for the specific J2EE requirements for web services.  Instead of using the traditional Apache server for this framework, JBoss has a server of its own, and is suggested that the framework is used on this server to get best performance. Similar to ASF, the JBoss community is a group of people that focus on open source projects.  Their projects emphasize on the development of Java Enterprise Middleware, which are software that act like bridge between applications, operating systems or both.

2.3. Codehaus XFire.
Codehaus XFire is a next-generation java SOAP framework.  It is a free and open source SOAP framework that allows you to implement web services with great ease and simplicity. It also provides many features identified in web service specifications, which are not yet available in most commercial or open source tools. It is claimed to have higher performance since it is built on a low memory StAX (Streaming API for XML) based model but there is no data to document this fact.

2.4. Hessian.
The Hessian binary web service protocol makes developing web services simple and usable without requiring a large framework so that developers would not need to spend more time and effort to learn an alphabet soup of protocols.  Since it is a binary protocol, it works well on sending binary data without any need to extend the protocol with attachments. J2ME devices like cell-phones PDAs can use Hessian to connect to web services with better performance, because it is a small protocol. Hessian was named after the Hessian cloth, which is the British term for Burlap. It was named this way because burlap is simple, practical, and useful, but extremely ordinary material, which is like the characteristics of the Hessian protocol.

3. Evaluation Metrics.
Different factors are considered when comparing the four frameworks in this project. Some metrics are to determine the performance and efficiency; some are to show the transparency and abstraction. This section explains these metrics.

3.1. Latency.
In terms of network, latency is an expression of how much time it takes for data to be sent back to a request.  This includes the time for the request to be sent to the server, the time the server spends on processing the task, and the time for the results to be sent back. The network latency is contributed by many factors, such as propagation, transmission, modem and router processing, and storage delays. The propagation is the time it takes for an object, such as data, to transfer from a location to another in the speed of light. Transmission is the delay from the medium like optical fiber or wireless networks. Modems and routers take time to check the headers of a packet. The storage delay is the time it takes for the actual hardware storage, such as hard drives, to store the received data. In this project, the latency is tested with different scenarios such as requesting 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 MB of data, and 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 clients simultaneous requesting data. From the results of such testing, trends can be found and compared for each framework.

3.2. Throughput.
Throughput is the amount of clients or data processed within a certain unit of time, like a second. It is highly related to latency, since scenarios with high latency would result in low throughput, and scenarios with low latency would result in high throughput. However, by viewing the latency graph, we can only tell the trends of response time, while we can determine the most efficient scenario for a framework through viewing a throughput graph.
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
3.3. Memory Usage.
In computing, memory is data storage to temporarily store data for calculations of the computer. There is a wide variety of memory, such as cache memory, flash memory, random access memory (RAM), virtual memory, etc. Either memory, they are all limited in server due to the cost and space. A framework that uses less memory would have an advantage of allowing higher capacity for the server.  

3.4. CPU Usage.
Central Processing Unit (CPU), also known as processor, is a component in a computer used to interpret program instructions and process data. Although it is only able to process one task at a time, when there are multiple tasks to be done, instead of finishing a task then going to another, the CPU is designed to switch to other tasks before finishing one if necessary, so that it would act like if it is executing multiple tasks at the same time. However, large tasks might occupy a lot of CPU time, which decreases the time scheduled for other tasks. A framework that uses less CPU would allow the server to have more time to execute other tasks.

3.5. Source Lines of Code.
The source lines of code (SLOC) used in a framework can indicate the transparency and abstraction of the framework. The main goal of a framework is to save the developer’s time and effort by not having to write the entire code from scratch. Thus the less lines of code that is required for a framework, the more time and effort is saved by this framework. However, lines of code cannot be exactly accurate since some lines might be long while some lines are short. So the number of files and size of files also is a consideration.

4. Statistical Analysis Methods.
After retrieving the test data to compare the performances, we need a method to analyze the results. By simply calculating the average response times and making them into a graphs is not sufficient for the analysis. Looking at the average response times 1.5 seconds and 1.6 seconds, we can not be sure if that is a great difference or not.  Therefore, statistical analysis methods are required to tell if the difference is significant or not. In this project, the general linear model (GLM) [9] and two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) is used for statistical analysis.  Furthermore, the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) [10] is used as a tool for aiding the calculations of the statistical analyses required.

4.1. The SAS System.
The SAS system is statistical analysis software that has a wide variety of statistical modules and procedures. They use a fourth-generation programming language (4GL) for their code and the programs are composed by three main components – the data step, the procedure step, and the macro language. The data step is for entering data, like inserting the data in the code or read from data files. The procedure step is the use of the statistical methods and models to analysis the data that was read in the data step.  The macro language is for decreasing the redundancy of functions that are used again and again throughout the program.

4.2. The GLM Model.
The GLM model is a statistical linear model that is used in general cases. It is the foundation of many statistical analyses, such as t-test, ANOVA, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), etc. The easiest case to understand how the GLM model works is the two-variable case. The goal of this analysis is to use a way to accurately describe the information in this plot. Using the GLM model, we try to find a straight line that is closest to all the dots in the plot.  This line would be written as: y = b0 + b1x + e, where y is the y-axis variable, x is the x-axis variable, b0 is the intercept (the value of y when x equals 0), b1 is the slope of the straight line, and e is the error. By solving b0 and b1, we can get information about this linear line that describes the dots in the plot. In other cases with more than two variables, the formula can be extended as: y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 + ... + bnxn + e, where n is the number of variables of the situation. But the mechanism for solving such problems is the same.

5. Results and Analyses.
In order to get best results from SAS analysis, each case is tested twenty times. Since four frameworks with five different amounts of clients are tested, there are twenty different cases. Adding the twenty test times for the twenty different cases would result 400 data sets to be calculated by SAS. Besides the amount of clients, the size of data is also considered. With also five different sizes of data sent, there would be twenty cases with a total of 400 data sets. The response time is measured by recording the time right before invoking the web service and recording the time right after the data requested is received then subtracting the time difference.

5.1.1. Client Scenarios.
For testing the four different frameworks in different scenarios, web service applications to send out data are created. The five scenarios based on amount of clients for testing performance of the four frameworks are 1 client, 5 clients, 10 clients, 15 clients, and 20 clients each retrieving 1 MB of data. The average response time for
